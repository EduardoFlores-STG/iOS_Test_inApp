# iOS_Test_inApp
Sample application of apple's in-app purchase.

This sample app is my attempt to create the simplest example of Apple's in-app purchase system.
The application itself is very small but it covers the basics of what the source code for the application is.

A much more detailed step-by-step set of instructions were added to my blog at this url:

In this blog post you will find all the necessary information and steps required on the developer.apple.com side,
along with the iTunesConnect side.
